        squares on the board. The disc must directly sandwich one or more
        opposing colours, in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions.
        This is then followed by the flipping of the sandwiched discs. If a
        player has no moves available to them. Their turn is forfeit until they
        have an available move.
