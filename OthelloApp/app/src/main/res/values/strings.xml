    <string name="rule1">An Othello game always starts off in this position
        shown; with two discs of each colour intersecting each other diagonally.
        The top right disc is always black from either players sitting view.
    </string>
    <string name="rule2">First move always goes to black, in order to make a
        legal move the player must place their colour on one of the empty
        squares on the board. The disc must directly sandwich one or more
        opposing colours, in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions.
        This is then followed by the flipping of the sandwiched discs. If a
        player has no moves available to them. Their turn is forfeit until they
        have an available move.
    </string>
    <string name="rule3">The game continues on until the players either run out
        of spaces on the board or there are no valid moves left.
        The winner is decided by the number of points or pieces he or she has.
        If a player runs out of time, they automatically lose, regardless
        of accumulated points
