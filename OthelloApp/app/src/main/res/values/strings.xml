    intersecting each other diagonally. The top right disc is always black from either players sitting view. </string>
    <string name="rule2">First move always goes to black, in order to make a legal move the player must place
    their colour on one of the empty squares on the board. The disc must directly sandwich one or more opposing colours,
        in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions. This is then followed by the flipping of the sandwiched discs.

    <string name="rule3">The game continues on until the players either run out of spaces on the board or there are no
    valid moves left. The winner is decided by the number of points or pieces he/she has.</string>
